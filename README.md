# FLEXRNet: Federated Learning + Edge XR Network with Adaptive RLNC

## Research Project Overview

## Abstract

FLEXRNet represents a breakthrough in distributed edge networking for Extended Reality (XR) applications, combining three cutting-edge technologies: Federated Learning (FL), Adaptive Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), and Priority-Aware Scheduling. Our system addresses the critical challenges of ultra-low latency requirements (≤20ms), high reliability (≥99.9%), and efficient resource utilization in multi-protocol edge networks supporting 50-200 concurrent XR users.

The core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of:
- **Adaptive RLNC** with dynamic redundancy factor adjustment (γ) based on real-time channel conditions
- **Edge-based Federated Learning** for distributed optimization without central coordination  
- **Priority-Aware Traffic Management** with Gold/Silver/Bronze service classes
- **Multi-Protocol Mesh Networks** supporting WiFi, mmWave, LoRa, and BLE

## Research Contributions

### 1. Novel System Architecture
- **Four-Layer Design**: Application → Edge AI → Network Coding → Physical Network
- **Cross-Layer Optimization**: Joint optimization of coding redundancy, airtime allocation, and next-hop selection
- **Heterogeneous Protocol Support**: Seamless switching between WiFi (mid-range), mmWave (high-rate/short), BLE (low-power), and LoRa (long-range)

### 2. Adaptive RLNC Algorithm
- **Dynamic Redundancy Control**: Real-time adjustment of coding factor γ based on estimated packet loss rates
- **Priority-Class Aware**: Different redundancy strategies for Gold (pose/audio), Silver (sensors), Bronze (bulk) traffic
- **Galois Field GF(2^8) Implementation**: Efficient linear algebraic operations for coding/decoding

### 3. Federated Learning Framework
- **Distributed Edge Intelligence**: Each node trains local RL policies for resource allocation
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Only model parameters shared, never raw user data
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Robust to node failures and network partitions

### 4. Real-Time Performance Guarantees
- **Gold Class**: ≤20ms latency, ≥99.9% reliability for XR pose/audio data
- **Silver Class**: ≤100ms latency, ≥99% reliability for sensor streams  
- **Bronze Class**: Throughput-optimized for texture/model downloads

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Simulation Engine**: Python 3.11 + SimPy for discrete event simulation
- **Network Modeling**: NetworkX for topology management and graph algorithms
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch for RL agents and federated learning
- **Visualization**: FastAPI + WebSockets + D3.js for real-time dashboards

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Adaptive RLNC Encoding
```python
def adaptive_rlnc_encode(generation, loss_estimate, target_success_prob):
    k = len(generation)  # Generation size
    gamma = calculate_redundancy_factor(loss_estimate, target_success_prob)
    coded_packets = []
    
    for i in range(ceil(gamma * k)):
        coefficients = [random.randint(1, 255) for _ in range(k)]
        coded_packet = linear_combination(generation, coefficients)
        coded_packets.append((coded_packet, coefficients))
    
    return coded_packets
```

#### 2. Priority-Aware Scheduler
```python
def schedule_packets(queues, link_capacities, current_time):
    # Gold class priority with deadline constraints
    for packet in queues['gold']:
        if packet.deadline - current_time < minimum_service_time:
            continue  # Skip to avoid deadline violation
        
        best_link = select_optimal_link(packet, link_capacities)
        if best_link:
            transmit(packet, best_link)
            
    # Silver and Bronze follow similar logic with lower priority
```

#### 3. Federated Learning Update
```python
def federated_update(local_models, client_weights):
    global_model = initialize_model()
    total_weight = sum(client_weights)
    
    for param_name in global_model.parameters():
        weighted_sum = sum(w * model[param_name] 
                          for w, model in zip(client_weights, local_models))
        global_model[param_name] = weighted_sum / total_weight
        
    return global_model
```
